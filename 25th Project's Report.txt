Dear mr.Ahmadzade:
This is a reporting about the codes which it's for Project No.25 that i've chosen.

At the begining, I defined an array named(numbers) which holds user's input to specify the size of the array. The (if) command after that, controles the user's input that user decides that how many elemmnts user wants and the user can't enter anything but numbers. Unless an error will be printed. After the user defined the array's size, in the (for) loop, the element will be counted from one to the number that user has entered for defining the array's size. Now user can enter numbers that he/she wants to know that it is odd or even. We also have codes which it is in(while) loop after getting elements to control the user's input again. In the next step, I defined two array to seperate the odd and even numbers by deviding. We have odd/even count.They will be used to keep track of how many even and odd numbers have been added to their respective arrays. In the (for) loop, we divide the user's input by two and if the remainder was zero, it will be placed as an even number  in the array and vise versa, if it wasn't, it will be placed as an odd number in the array. The(even/oddCount++) define the other inputs and they place them in the next empty position of the array. And eventually, the last part is for displaying the results. The (for) loop represents the odd and the even numbers that they were added in the array and they will be shown by (Console.WriteLine). We had some (goto) commands and(start points) that if the user entered an invalid input, the user can continue without exciting and at the end of the code(After displaying the results), the user will be taken to the first step.
